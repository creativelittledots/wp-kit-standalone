# wp-kit/standalone

**This repo is being discontinued to make way for [```Themosis```](http://framework.themosis.com/). Themosis works at root level which makes this repo redundant.** 

```wp-kit/standalone``` was created for use cases where users require the installation of ```wp-kit``` in a subdirectory situated inside the root folder a Wordpress install.

```wp-kit``` is a ```RAD``` (Rapid Application Development) solution for ```Wordpress```.
